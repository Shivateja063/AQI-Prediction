# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview

Air pollution is a major health hazard in urban areas like **Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad**. The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** quantifies air pollution levels on a scale from **0 to 500**, where higher values indicate greater risk.  

This project uses **Machine Learning** to **predict AQI levels**, enabling timely interventions for public health and environmental monitoring.

## 🌟 Features

- **📊 Data Preprocessing**  
  - Cleaning and normalizing AQI datasets from multiple Indian cities.  
  - Handling missing values and preparing data for model training.

- **🤖 Predictive Modeling**  
  - Models used: **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and more.  
  - Forecasting AQI levels and classifying them into health categories.

- **⚖️ Imbalance Handling**  
  - Implementing **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to address class imbalance.

- **📈 Model Evaluation**  
  - Metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**, and **Confusion Matrix**.
